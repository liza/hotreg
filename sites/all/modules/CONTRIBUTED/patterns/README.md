# Patterns, Drupal 7.x module

Complex websites and web applications can be created by combining
configurations of Modules, Fields, Content Types, Menus, Blocks,
Categories, Roles / Permissions, etc... This site setup and
configuration process is a very time consuming and repetitive
bottleneck.

The Patterns module is built to bypass this bottleneck by managing and
automating site configuration. Site configuration is stored in YAML, XML, or
PHP files called Patterns. These files have a structure which is
easy to read, modify, manage, & share and can be executed manually or as
a part of an automated web site deployment.
